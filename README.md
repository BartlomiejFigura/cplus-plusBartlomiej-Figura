Hello. I've started my adventure with c++ in medium school. We learned basics, variables, conditionals and loops.
After school I didn't go to college, otherwise I started my company in transport. In that time I was learning html5 and css from codilla course, but after accident in Italy(I've crashed to big truck with my truck)  I ended learning front end, because of damage in my laptop.
Now I have taxi and I'm driving in Bielsko-Biała. I reminded myself that I liked programming in medium school and in course. I've downloaded app sololearn. Now I'm learning c++ (remind stack from medium school) and python(basics).It made me realize, that I like programming and want to improve my programming skills and start my programming carrer. 
I can make license taxi for Kraków and driving after learning in your academy. That should help me keep my finance in good condition.
